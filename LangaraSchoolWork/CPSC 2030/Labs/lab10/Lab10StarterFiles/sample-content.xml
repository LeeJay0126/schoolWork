<p><em>The following comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Wikipedia</a></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><b>Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace</b> (<i>née</i> <b>Byron</b>; 10 December 1815&nbsp;– 27 November 1852) was an English <a title="Mathematician" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician">mathematician</a> and writer, chiefly known for her work on <a title="Charles Babbage" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>'s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the <a title="Analytical Engine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine">Analytical Engine</a>. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and created the first <a title="Algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a> intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and the first computer <a title="Programmer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer">programmer</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Lovelace_Google_3-0" class="reference"></sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ada Lovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet <a title="Lord Byron" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron">Lord Byron</a>, and his wife <a title="Anne Isabella Byron, Baroness Byron" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Isabella_Byron,_Baroness_Byron">Anne Isabella Milbanke</a> ("Annabella"), Lady Wentworth. All of <a title="Lord Byron" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron#Children">Byron's other children</a> were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later, eventually dying of disease in the <a title="Greek War of Independence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_War_of_Independence">Greek War of Independence</a> when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter towards Lord Byron and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing what she saw as the <a title="Insanity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity">insanity</a> seen in her father, but Ada remained interested in him despite this (and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request). Often ill, she spent most of her childhood sick. Ada married <a title="William King-Noel, 1st Earl of Lovelace" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_King-Noel,_1st_Earl_of_Lovelace">William King</a> in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, and she became Countess of Lovelace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as <a title="Andrew Crosse" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Crosse">Andrew Crosse</a>, <a title="David Brewster" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brewster">Sir David Brewster</a>, <a title="Charles Wheatstone" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wheatstone">Charles Wheatstone</a>, <a title="Michael Faraday" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday">Michael Faraday</a> and the author <a title="Charles Dickens" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as "poetical science"<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEToole1998234.E2.80.93235_6-0" class="reference"></sup> and herself as an "Analyst (&amp; Metaphysician)".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician <a title="Charles Babbage" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>, also known as "the father of computers", and in particular, Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, <a title="Mary Somerville" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Somerville">Mary Somerville</a>. Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer <a class="mw-redirect" title="Luigi Menabrea" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Menabrea">Luigi Menabrea</a> on the engine, which she supplemented with an elaborate set of notes, simply called <i>Notes</i>. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Lovelace's notes are important in the early <a class="mw-redirect" title="History of computers" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computers">history of computers</a>. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.&nbsp; She died of <a title="Uterine cancer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_cancer">uterine cancer</a> in 1852 at the age of 36.</p>

<p><em>The following comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">W</a></em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper"><em>ikipedia</em></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><b>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper</b> (<a title="Given name" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#Name_at_birth">née</a>&nbsp;<b>Murray</b>; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American <a title="Computer scientist" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist">computer scientist</a> and <a title="United States Navy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy">United States Navy</a> <a title="Rear admiral (United States)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_admiral_%28United_States%29">rear admiral</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"></sup> One of the first programmers of the <a title="Harvard Mark I" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I">Harvard Mark I</a> computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming, inventing the first <a title="Compiler" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a> for any computer programming language. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of <a title="COBOL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>, one of the first <a title="High-level programming language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">high-level programming languages</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hopper had tried to enlist in the Navy during <a title="World War II" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>. She had to join the Navy Reserves because she was too old to enlist at the age of 34. Hopper started her computing career working in the Harvard Mark I team led by <a title="Howard H. Aiken" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken">Howard H. Aiken</a>. In 1949, she joined the <a title="Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckert%E2%80%93Mauchly_Computer_Corporation">Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation</a>, joining the team that developed the <a title="UNIVAC I" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I">UNIVAC I</a> in 1944. It was at Eckert–Mauchly that she began developing the compiler. She believed that computer code could be written in English using a programming language based on English words. The compiler would convert that code into <a title="Machine code" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code">machine code</a> understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper finished her compiler, which was written for the <a title="A-0 System" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-0_System">A-0 System</a> programming language.<sup id="cite_ref-Spencer85_2-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Booss03_5-0" class="reference"></sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like <a title="FLOW-MATIC" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW-MATIC">FLOW-MATIC</a>. In 1959, she participated in the <a title="CODASYL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CODASYL">CODASYL</a> consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language, inspired by her idea of a language being based on English. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967, the Navy recalled her into active duty. In the Navy, she launched programs that helped standardize COBOL as well as newer languages like <a title="Fortran" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a>. She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the <a title="Digital Equipment Corporation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a>, sharing her computing experiences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Owing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she was sometimes referred to as "<a title="Amazing Grace" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Grace">Amazing Grace</a>". The U.S. Navy <a title="Arleigh Burke-class destroyer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arleigh_Burke-class_destroyer"><i>Arleigh Burke</i>-class</a> guided-missile destroyer <a title="USS Hopper" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Hopper">USS&nbsp;<i>Hopper</i></a> was named for her, as was the <a title="Cray XE6" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_XE6">Cray XE6</a> "Hopper" supercomputer at <a class="mw-redirect" title="NERSC" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NERSC">NERSC</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. In 1991, she received the <a title="National Medal of Technology and Innovation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Medal_of_Technology_and_Innovation">National Medal of Technology</a>. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the <a title="Presidential Medal of Freedom" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> by President <a title="Barack Obama" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"></sup></p>

Wilson designed the <a title="Acorn System 1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_System_1">Acorn Micro-Computer</a>, the first of a long line of computers sold by <a class="mw-redirect" title="Acorn Computers Ltd" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Computers_Ltd">Acorn Computers Ltd</a>, including its programming language <a title="BBC BASIC" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC">BBC BASIC</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-bbcbasic_6-0" class="reference"></sup> Wilson later designed the instruction set of the <a title="ARM architecture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM processor</a>, which became the <i>de facto</i> model used in 21st-century <a class="mw-redirect" title="Smartphones" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphones">smartphones</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1978, Wilson joined <a class="mw-redirect" title="Acorn Computers Ltd" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Computers_Ltd">Acorn Computers Ltd</a>, after designing a device to prevent cigarette lighter sparks triggering payouts on <a title="Slot machine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_machine">fruit machines</a>. <sup id="cite_ref-reg_8-1" class="reference"></sup>Wilson's computer design was used by <a class="mw-redirect" title="Chris Curry" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Curry">Chris Curry</a> and <a title="Hermann Hauser" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hauser">Hermann Hauser</a> to build the <a title="Acorn System 1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_System_1">Acorn Micro-Computer</a>, the first of a long line of computers sold by the company.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In July 1981, Wilson extended the <a title="Acorn Atom" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Atom">Acorn Atom</a>'s <a class="mw-redirect" title="BASIC programming language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_programming_language">BASIC programming language</a> dialect into an improved version for the Acorn Proton, a microcomputer that enabled Acorn to win the contract with the <a title="BBC" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)</a> for their ambitious computer education project.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGelenbe2009119_9-0" class="reference"></sup> Hauser played a mental game where he told both Wilson and colleague <a title="Steve Furber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber">Steve Furber</a> that the other had agreed a prototype could be built within a week. Agreeing to the challenge, Wilson designed the system including the circuit board and components from Monday to Wednesday, which required fast new <a class="mw-redirect" title="DRAM" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRAM">DRAM</a> <a class="mw-redirect" title="Integrated circuits" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuits">integrated circuits</a> to be sourced directly from <a title="Hitachi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi">Hitachi</a>. By Thursday evening, a prototype had been built, but the software had <a class="mw-redirect" title="Bug (software)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_%28software%29">bugs</a>, requiring Wilson to stay up all night and into Friday debugging. Wilson recalled watching the <a title="Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Charles,_Prince_of_Wales,_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer">wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer</a> on a small portable television while attempting to debug and re-solder the prototype. It was a success with the BBC, who awarded Acorn the contract. Along with Furber, Wilson was present backstage at the machine's first airing on television, in case any software fixes were required. Wilson later described the event as "a unique moment in time when the public wanted to know how this stuff works and could be shown and taught how to program." The Proton became the <a title="BBC Micro" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro">BBC Micro</a> and its BASIC evolved into <a title="BBC BASIC" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC">BBC BASIC</a>, whose development was led by Wilson for the next 15 years. As well as programming, Wilson wrote the manuals and technical specifications, realising communication was an important part of being successful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In October 1983, Wilson began designing the instruction set for one of the first <a class="mw-redirect" title="RISC" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC">RISC</a> processors, the <a title="ARM architecture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">Acorn RISC Machine (ARM)</a>, <sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGelenbe2009121_11-0" class="reference"></sup>The ARM1 was delivered on 26 April 1985 and worked first time. This processor type was later to become one of the most successful <a class="mw-redirect" title="IP core" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_core">IP cores</a> (i.e., a licensed <a title="Central processing unit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> core) and by 2012 was being used in 95% of <a title="Smartphone" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone">smartphones</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wilson designed Acorn Replay, the video architecture for Acorn machines. This included the operating system extensions for video access as well as the <a title="Codec" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec">codecs</a> themselves, optimized to run high frame rate video on ARM CPUs from the ARM 2 onwards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wilson was a member of the board of the technology and games company Eidos plc, which bought and created <a title="Eidos Interactive" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidos_Interactive">Eidos Interactive</a>, for the years following its <a title="Initial public offering" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering">flotation</a> in 1990, and was a consultant to <a class="mw-redirect" title="ARM Ltd" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Ltd">ARM Ltd</a> when it was split off from Acorn in 1990.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the demise of Acorn Computers, Wilson has made a small number of public appearances to talk about work done there.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"></sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wilson is now the Director of IC Design in <a title="Broadcom" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcom">Broadcom</a>’s Cambridge, UK office. <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"></sup>She was the Chief Architect of Broadcom's Firepath processor. Firepath has its history in Acorn Computers, which, after being renamed to Element 14, was bought by Broadcom in 2000.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was listed in 2011 in <i><a title="Maximum PC" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_PC">Maximum PC</a></i> as <span class="nowrap">number 8</span> in an article entitled <i>The 15 Most Important Women in Tech History</i>. <sup id="cite_ref-maximumpc_2011_16-0" class="reference"></sup>She was awarded the Fellow Award by the <a title="Computer History Museum" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_History_Museum">Computer History Museum</a> in California in 2012 "for her work, with Steve Furber, on the BBC Micro computer and the ARM processor architecture."
