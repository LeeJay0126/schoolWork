Question 3:

int largePump
int smallPump
int poolcap
double hours
double smallPumpvalue
double largePumpvalue

display "Enter the number of large pumps: "
read largePump
display "Enter the number of small pumps: "
read smallPump
set poolcap to 1
set largePumpValue to largePump * 0.1
set smallPumpValue to smallPump * 0.05
set hours to poolcap / (largePumpValue + smallPumpValue)

display "It will take " + hours + " hours to fill up the pool with " 
+ largePump + " large pumps and " + smallPump + " small pumps."


Question 5:

double contributionAmount
int years
double futureValue
double cinterest
int principalInvestment
double total

display "Enter the monthly contribution amout: :
read contributionAmount
display "Enter the number of years: "
read years

set futureValue to contributionAmount*(pow(1+0.09/12,(12*years))-1)/(0.09/12);
set cinterest to (1+0.09/12)^120 * principalInvestment
set total to futureValue + cinterest
set principalInvestment to 5000

display "After " + years + " years, the portfolio value is " + total

6.

double tempFahr
double speedMiles
double windChill

display "Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit (must be between -58F and 41F): "
read tempFahr
display "Enter the wind speed miles per hour (must be greater than or equal to 2): "
read speedMiles
windChill = (35.74 + (0.6215*Fahrenheit)-(35.75*pow(speedMiles,0.16))+(0.4275*Fahrenheit*pow(speedMiles,0.16)))
display "The wind chill index is :" + windChill


Pseudocodes for 7 and 8 (not for marks) :

double bowBackDist
double stiffness
double arrowMass
double Velocity
double potentialEnergy
double KineticEnergy

display "Enter the pull back distance of bow in m: "
read bowBackDist
display "Enter the stiffness of bow in N/m: "
read stiffness
display "Enter the arrow's mass in g: "
read arrowMass

set potentialEnergy to (1/2*stiffness*pow(bowBackDist,2))
set KineticEnergy to potentialEnergy
set velocity to sqrt(kineticEnergy*2*mass)

display "The velocity of arrow right after release is " + velocity + " m/s"
