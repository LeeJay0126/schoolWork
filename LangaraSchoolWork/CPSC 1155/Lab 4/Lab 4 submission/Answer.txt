int i = 1, j = 2, k = 5;

cout << "1: " << (5 < 1 - 2) << endl;
(5< -1) = false
= "1: false"

int i = 1, j = 2, k = 5;
++1 == j
++1 (2) == 2
="2: true"

int i = 2, j = 2, k = 5;
((k - i-- > j) && ( i == k % j))
5 - 2 > 2 AND 2 == 5 % 2
3 > 2 (true) AND 2 == 5 % 2 (false)
="3: false"

^ gotta ask question about q3

int i = 1, j = 2, k = 5;
(!(k > j) || (i == k % j))
!(5 > 2) || (1 == 5 % 2)
NOT (true) OR True
="4: true"

int i = 1, j = 2, k = 5;
(((k-i) && (j > 2)) || !i)
((5 - 1) && (2 > 2)) || !1)
 4 && false || !1
 false || !1
 
 
2.

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main(){

double price;

cout << "What is the price? Enter :";
cin >> price;
if(price > 10){
    price = price -3.14;
}else if(price < 10){
    price = price - 1;
}
cout << "Discounted price: " << price << endl;


}

Input value: 10
Expected Output: 10
comment: we need to include <= or >= for one of the ifs. because it is
not properly included in the code item that costs exactly 10 dollars won't be getting a discount.

Input value: 9
Expected Output: 8
comment: output was 8 because it was less than 10 dollars

Input value: 11
Expected Output: 7.86
comment: output was 7.86 because 11 - 3.14 

input value: -4
expected output: -5
comment: -4 is an invalid input, but since it is still less than 10 dollars, we are gettin -5 as a result.

a. 
inputs: current time (rush hour or not) and the route
outputs: travelling time 
constants: time it takes depending if its during rush hour or not and the route.
conditions: user taking normal route/ baybridge route and travelling during rushhour/ regular hours

b.
normal route + rush hour = 60min
normal route + regular hour = 40min
bayBridge + rush hour = 45min
bayBridge + regular hours = 30min


c.
int normalRoute
int bayBridge
const RUSHHOUR_B = 45
const REGULARHOUR_N = 40
const RUSHHOUR_N = 60
const REGULARHOUR_B = 30
int userinput

d.

Check lab4 Question 5 step 4.dox

e. 

int normalRoute
int bayBridge
const RUSHHOUR_B = 45
const REGULARHOUR_N = 40
const RUSHHOUR_N = 60
const REGULARHOUR_B = 30
int userInputRoute 
int userInputHours

display "Are you travelling by normal route or Bay bridge? Enter 1 for normal route and 2 for bay bridge. :"
read userInputRoute
display "Are you travelling during rush hour? Enter  1 if yes, 0 if not. : "
read userInputeHours

if (userInputRoute == 1){

    if (userInputHours == 1){
        display "Your travelling time will be " + RUSHHOUR_N
    }else{
        display "Your travelling time will be " + REGULARHOUR_N
    }

}else if (userInputRoute == 2){

     if (userInputeHours == 1){
        display "Your travelling time will be " + RUSHHOUR_B
    }else{
        display "Your travelling time will be " + REGULARHOUR_B
    }
