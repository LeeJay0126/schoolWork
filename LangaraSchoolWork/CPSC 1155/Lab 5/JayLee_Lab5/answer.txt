b. x == 0 || y == 0
c. (x == 0 && y != 0) || ( x != 0 && y == 0) || ( x != 0 && y != 0)
d. x != 0 && y != 0
e. (x != 0 && y == 0)|| (x == 0 && y != 0)

Question 3


if (letter == a || letter == c || letter == e || letter == g){

    if(number == 1 || number == 3 || number == 5 || number == 7){
        cout << "square is purple";
    }else if(number == 2 || number == 4 || number == 6 || number == 8){
        cout << "squre is light purple";
    }

}else if (letter == b || letter == d || letter == f || letter == h){

    if(number == 1 || number == 3 || number == 5 || number == 7){
         cout << "squre is light purple";
    }else if(number == 2 || number == 4 || number == 6 || number == 8){
         cout << "square is purple";
    }


}


Question 4

if((year % 4) == 0){
	if(year % 100 == 0){
		if(year % 400 == 0){
			cout << year << " is a leap year. Month of february has 29 days in this year.";
		}else{
			cout << year <<  "is not a leap year. Month of february has 28 days in this year.";
		}
		break;
	}
	else{
		cout << year << " is a leap year. Month of february has 29 days in this year.";
	}
	break;
}
else {
	cout << year <<  "is not a leap year. Month of february has 28 days in this year.";
}

In a single if statement form :

((year % 4) == 0 && (year % 100) == 0 && (year % 400) == 0 ) || ((year % 4) == 0 && (year % 100) != 0)



Question 5

For Version 1:
You need to use else if statement after first if statement, otherwise code will execute all the codes that follows the first if statement. 

ex. if hour is 4, it will execute first if statement and print night, and since if hour is 5, all the following if statements will be true. 
So the print out will be :nightmorningafternoonevening

correct statement will be:

int main(){

    int hour;
    
    cout << "Enter hour: ";
    cin >> hour;

    if(hour < 6){
        cout << "night";
    }else if (hour < 12){
        cout << "morning";
    }else if (hour < 18){
        cout << "afternoon";
    }else if (hour < 24){
        cout << "evening";
    }

}

For version 2:

else if is used correctly to execute one code at a time, but since hour < 18 if statement comes first, when an input like 3 is 
inputted, it will execute the first block of code first and get a wrong result as intended.

first if statement should be if((hour < 18) || hour > 12 ) or hour < 6 should come first.


correct statement:


int main(){

    int hour;
    
    cout << "Enter hour: ";
    cin >> hour;

    if(hour < 6){
        cout << "night";
    }else if (hour < 12){
        cout << "morning";
    }else if (hour < 18){
        cout << "afternoon";
    }else if (hour < 24){
        cout << "evening";
    }

}
