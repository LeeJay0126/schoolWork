            How my work experience and courses will help me

            <p>
                Working for each and every single workplace I've worked for has been unique experience for me. I have
                learned how to deal with customers, and furthermore learn to work with my coworkers and approach them
                first.
                At my current work place, Tapestry retirement home, I work as a server in their restaurant and having to
                deal with elders with passion and responsibility, I have learned to strictly self-deciplin myself, keep
                ethical high grounds and set high standards for my work ethics. From the courses I learned in Langara
                College, studying about HTML, CSS, javascript and its' algorithm made me a capable web designer. I love
                howthey are very closely related as they are complimentary to each other and look forward to learn more
                about them.
