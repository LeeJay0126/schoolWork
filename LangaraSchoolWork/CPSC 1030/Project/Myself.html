                <p>
                    As a kid, I enjoyed watching basketball and playing video games. It was inevitable for me to be
                    interested
                    in how the world of computer science worked. My passion for Web designing started when I started my
                    education in Langara College in 2020, in an intro class of CPSC 1030 where I learned how to play
                    with HTML
                    and CSS, designing web pages. Ever since then, I had a passion for web designing.

                My background:
            </h3>

            <p>
                I was born in Seoul, South Korea and then moved out of Korea in grade 2. It has been 11 years since I
                came to Canada and I'm loving this country. I moved a lot within mainland vancouver and met variety of
                new people. I learned a lot of different culture in Vancouver, and developed a way to cope and accept
                the difference between cultures. Our family settled down in Coquitlam/ Portmoody area where I spent most
                of my life in since we immigrated to Canada.

                After graduating from highschool, I have been working as a server, and sales representative for
                Zara, Sushi restaurants, Tapestry, and Wireless Wave. I have learned how to cooperate with
                co-workers and learned to adapt to new work places efficiently. Meanwhile, after studying Psyc in
                Douglas College, I finally found something that intrigued me enough to dedicate my career to:
                Computer Science. I have learned to design web pages and programming with javascript along with
                algorithm. I am seeking for an opportunity to work for a company to dedicate my passion and continue
                to learn and grow.
