        <h1>The Sun</h1>
        <p>I like the Sun.
        I don't know much science behind the sun, but I like sunshine and warmth it gives. I love warm summer
         and summer activities. Warm, sunny day makes my mood hype up and even just staying in my room knowing the 
        day is sunny makes my day. </p>
        <p>I face profound depression during the winter because there rarely ever is a sunny day here in vancouver during the season.
            I bet 95% of world population prefer sun over rain. Anyday.
